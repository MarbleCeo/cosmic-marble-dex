# Cosmic Marble Nexus â€” Version 0.2 Beta

A streamlined, customer-centric blockchain platform focused exclusively on wallet transactions and a decentralized exchange (DEX) for token swaps and transfers.

## Highlights

- **Wallet Integration**: Connect multiple wallets (Solana, Ethereum, Binance, Cosmic Marble) to trade tokens seamlessly.
- **Multi-Chain DEX**: Swap tokens across supported blockchain networks in a simple, easy-to-use interface.
- **On-Chain Transactions**: Perform real token transfers and swaps on connected blockchain nodes via RPC.
- **Token Minting**: Use CMX tokens to mint your own custom tokens directly from the DEX.
- **Token Mapping**: Large token mapping system compatible with major chains for seamless swaps.
- **User Focused**: Built for general customers, not validators or infrastructure operators.

## How to Use the Wallet & DEX

1. **Connect Wallet**: Use the "Connect Wallet" button in the Dashboard to link your compatible wallet.
2. **Select Token Pair**: Choose from various trading pairs on supported blockchains.
3. **Swap Tokens**: Enter the amount to swap and execute on-chain trades with minimal fees.
4. **Mint Tokens**: Create your own tokens by paying CMX fees to launch on the Cosmic Marble blockchain.
5. **Maintain Balances**: View your token balances and transaction statuses updated in real-time.
